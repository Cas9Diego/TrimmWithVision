# TrimmWithVision

Count the number of faces in a photo 

Structure

    iOS/You will find the Xcode project containing all you need to run the App. 

Requirements

    To run the iOS project, you must use Xcode 13.3 or later.

Frameworks

    SwiftUI
    Foundation
    Vision
    CoreImage
    PhotosUI

IMPORTANT: The Vision framework is unable to work properly in the simulator, so you should run the app on an actual IPhone in order to get a functioning App.

How it Works:
                
Tap the "choose a picture" button, a sheet will be displayed to allow you to choose a photo by tapping on it. After tapping on the photo, press the "Scan" button, a text will appear below that button displaying the number of faces in the picture. The detected faces will also be squared in yellow.
