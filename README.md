# TrimmWithVision

Count the number of faces in a photo 

Structure

iOS/
You will find the Xcode project containing all you need to run the App. 

Requirements

To run the iOS project, you must use Xcode 13.3 or later.

Frameworks

Vision
CoreImage

IMPORTANT: The vision framework is unable to work properly in the simulation, so you should run the app on an actual IPhone in order to get a functioning App.

How it Works:
Tap the "choose a picture" button, a sheet will display to allow you to choose a photo by tapping on it. After tapping on the photo, press the "Face CPunt" button, a text will appear below that button displaying the number of faces in the picture.
